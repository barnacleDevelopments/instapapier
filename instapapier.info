3 Configuration
***************

Instapapier uses Emacs' built-in ‘auth-source’ library for secure
credential management.

* Menu:

* Setting Up Instapaper::       Creating an Instapaper account
* Configuring Authentication::  Setting up credentials in Emacs
* Testing Authentication::      Verifying your setup


File: instapapier.info,  Node: Setting Up Instapaper,  Next: Configuring Authentication,  Up: Configuration

3.1 Setting Up Instapaper
=========================

If you don't already have an Instapaper account:

  1. Visit <https://www.instapaper.com/>
  2. Click "Sign Up" in the top right corner
  3. Enter your email address and choose a password
  4. Verify your email address


File: instapapier.info,  Node: Configuring Authentication,  Next: Testing Authentication,  Prev: Setting Up Instapaper,  Up: Configuration

3.2 Configuring Authentication
==============================

You need to add your Instapaper credentials to an ‘auth-source’ file.
There are two main options:

* Menu:

* Plain Text Credentials::      Using ~/.authinfo
* Encrypted Credentials::       Using ~/.authinfo.gpg (recommended)


File: instapapier.info,  Node: Plain Text Credentials,  Next: Encrypted Credentials,  Up: Configuring Authentication

3.2.1 Plain Text Credentials
----------------------------

Create or edit ‘~/.authinfo’ and add:

     machine www.instapaper.com login your-email@example.com password your-password

   *Important:* This file stores credentials in plain text.  Secure it
with:

     chmod 600 ~/.authinfo


File: instapapier.info,  Node: Encrypted Credentials,  Prev: Plain Text Credentials,  Up: Configuring Authentication

3.2.2 Encrypted Credentials (Recommended)
-----------------------------------------

For better security, use an encrypted file:

  1. Create or edit ‘~/.authinfo.gpg’

  2. Add the same line as the plain text version:

          machine www.instapaper.com login your-email@example.com password your-password

  3. Save the file (Emacs will prompt you to encrypt it with GPG)

   Ensure GPG is configured in Emacs:

     (require 'epa-file)
     (epa-file-enable)


File: instapapier.info,  Node: Testing Authentication,  Prev: Configuring Authentication,  Up: Configuration

3.3 Testing Authentication
==========================

After configuring your credentials, verify they work:

     M-x instapapier-test-auth

   You should see "‘✓ Authentication successful!’" in the minibuffer.

     M-x instapapier-add-url-at-point

   The command will detect the URL at point and send it to Instapaper.

   *Suggested keybinding:*

     (global-set-key (kbd "C-c i a") 'instapapier-add-url-at-point)


File: instapapier.info,  Node: Adding URLs Interactively,  Next: Keybindings,  Prev: Adding URLs at Point,  Up: Usage

4.2 Adding URLs Interactively
=============================

To manually enter a URL:

     M-x instapapier-interactively-add-url

   You'll be prompted to enter the URL in the minibuffer.

   *Suggested keybinding:*

     (global-set-key (kbd "C-c i u") 'instapapier-interactively-add-url)


File: instapapier.info,  Node: Keybindings,  Prev: Adding URLs Interactively,  Up: Usage

4.3 Keybindings
===============

Here's a complete keybinding configuration:

     (global-set-key (kbd "C-c i a") 'instapapier-add-url-at-point)
     (global-set-key (kbd "C-c i u") 'instapapier-interactively-add-url)

   Or using ‘use-package’:

     (use-package instapapier
       :bind (("C-c i a" . instapapier-add-url-at-point)
              ("C-c i u" . instapapier-interactively-add-url)))

5 Integrations
**************

Instapapier integrates seamlessly with other Emacs packages.

* Menu:

* Elfeed Integration::          Saving RSS feed entries


File: instapapier.info,  Node: Elfeed Integration,  Up: Integrations

5.1 Elfeed Integration
======================

Elfeed is a popular RSS feed reader for Emacs.  Instapapier provides
direct integration to save feed entries to Instapaper.

5.1.1 Setting Up Elfeed
-----------------------

First, install and configure elfeed:

     (use-package elfeed
       :ensure t
       :config
       (setq elfeed-feeds
             '("https://planet.emacslife.com/atom.xml"
               "https://sachachua.com/blog/feed/")))

5.1.2 Adding Elfeed Entries to Instapaper
-----------------------------------------

In the elfeed search buffer, place your cursor on an entry and run:

     M-x instapapier-add-elfeed-entry-at-point

   *Suggested configuration:*

     (use-package elfeed
       :ensure t
       :bind (:map elfeed-search-mode-map
                   ("i" . instapapier-add-elfeed-entry-at-point))
       :config
       (setq elfeed-feeds
             '("https://planet.emacslife.com/atom.xml"
               "https://sachachua.com/blog/feed/")))

   Now you can press ‘i’ on any entry in elfeed to save it to
Instapaper.

File: instapapier.info,  Node: Authentication Issues,  Next: Credential Issues,  Up: Troubleshooting

6.1 Authentication Issues
=========================

If you see "‘✗ Authentication failed’":

  1. Verify your credentials in ‘~/.authinfo’ or ‘~/.authinfo.gpg’

  2. Ensure you're using your actual Instapaper email and password

  3. Run ‘M-x instapapier-test-auth’ to test authentication

  4. Check that the machine name is exactly ‘www.instapaper.com’

  5. Verify the format is: ‘machine www.instapaper.com login EMAIL
     password PASSWORD’


File: instapapier.info,  Node: Credential Issues,  Next: GPG Issues,  Prev: Authentication Issues,  Up: Troubleshooting

6.2 Credential Issues
=====================

If auth-source can't find your credentials, ensure it's configured
correctly:

     (setq auth-sources '("~/.authinfo.gpg" "~/.authinfo"))

   Check which files auth-source is searching:

     (message "auth-sources: %s" auth-sources)


File: instapapier.info,  Node: GPG Issues,  Next: Network Issues,  Prev: Credential Issues,  Up: Troubleshooting

6.3 GPG Issues
==============

If you have trouble with ‘.authinfo.gpg’:

  1. Ensure GPG is installed:

          gpg --version

  2. Configure EPA (EasyPG) in Emacs:

          (require 'epa-file)
          (epa-file-enable)

  3. Test decryption by opening ‘~/.authinfo.gpg’ in Emacs


File: instapapier.info,  Node: Network Issues,  Prev: GPG Issues,  Up: Troubleshooting

6.4 Network Issues
==================

If you experience network problems:

  1. Check your internet connection

  2. Enable debug logging:

          (setq url-debug t)

  3. Check the ‘*URL-DEBUG*’ buffer for detailed error messages

  4. Verify you can reach Instapaper:

          curl -I https://www.instapaper.com/api/authenticate
